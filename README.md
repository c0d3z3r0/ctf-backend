# CTF@HSO Backend
This is the backend which should have been developed but we decided to use CTFd. Maybe this will be useful at some time later.

## Deployment
Install all dependencies inside the project directory.

~~~bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
./composer.phar install --no-dev
~~~
